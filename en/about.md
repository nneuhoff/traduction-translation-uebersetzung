## ABOUT ME

*“Language is the road map of a culture. It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.”* - Rita Mae Brown 

The above quote highlights the profound connection between language and culture. It's a link that lies at the heart of translation, and one that roots itself in my
professional services. 

After all, translation is more than just transferring words or phrases. It requires a deep understanding of language, culture, and content, as well as the ability to effectively convey the essence of a text into the target language.

During my studies in Translation at the University of Leipzig, I have gained comprehensive knowledge of translation theory and practice. In addition, my professional experience as a translator and copywriter in marketing has taught me how to engage audiences through language effectively. 

I am currently expanding my expertise through a Master’s program in Translation and Professional Writing at the University of Brest (France) and offer my services as a freelance translator and copywriter.
