## RATES

Every text is unique, as is the rate. The cost of a translation usually depends on **the length of the text, its level of difficulty, and the desired delivery date**. Simply send me your text via the [**contact form**](https://nneuhoff.github.io/traduction-translation-uebersetzung/en/contact.html) and I will provide you with a **customized quote**. All content and information will, of course, be treated confidentially.

### Indicative rates*:
- per source word: €0.14
- per standard line (55 keystrokes): €1.15

*The price of each order includes one revision in the event of any changes being requested.*

*VAT not charged under Article 293 B of the French CGI.
